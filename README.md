This is the files related to the current implementation of the Hello Phantom\n
[Deprecated] proof-of-concept: Contains files used when originally created as a proof-of-concept; To be used only for reference, not actually implemented without overhaul of program structure\n
final: Meant to be identical to the 'final' folder on the Raspberry Pi; Contains files and classes run during execution\n
misc: Meant for other files to be shared to/from the Raspberry Pi; Will get cluttered + deleted from time to time, so don't count on keeping these here long term (share + download quickly)
