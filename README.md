These are the files related to the current implementation of the <b>Hello Phantom</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>[Deprecated] proof-of-concept:</b> Contains files used when originally created as a proof-of-concept; To be used only for reference, not actually implemented without overhaul of program structure</li>
  <li><b>final:</b> Meant to be identical to the 'final' folder on the Raspberry Pi; Contains files and classes run during execution</li>
  <li><b>misc:</b> Meant for other files to be shared to/from the Raspberry Pi; Will get cluttered + deleted from time to time, so don't count on keeping these here long term (share + download quickly)</li>
</ul>
